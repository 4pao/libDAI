- Idea: a FactorGraph and a RegionGraph are often equipped with
extra properties for nodes and edges. The code to initialize those
is often quite similar; maybe this can be abstracted to classes
like ExtFactorGraph and ExtRegionGraph (Ext stands for Extended), e.g.
template <typename NodeProperties, typename EdgeProperties>
class ExtFactorGraph : public FactorGraph {
	public:
		std::vector<NodeProperties>               nodeProps;
		std::vector<std::vector<EdgeProperties> > edgeProps;
	// blabla
}
A disadvantage of this approach may be worse cachability.

- Would it be a good idea to cache second-order neighborhoods (delta's) in BipGraph?
- Would it be a good idea to add the variable label -> index hashmap in FactorGraph,
  to replace the linear searches that are performed every time for findVar()?
  No, a better idea is to avoid calls to findVar() as much as possible.
- Can the FactorGraph constructors be optimized further?
- Move FactorGraph::_normType somewhere else (maybe to InfAlg or DAIAlg<T>)
- Remove updatedFactor
- Add Exceptions framework; this can e.g. be used as follows: if *.logZ() is
called, it can return an exception if this method is not implemented, and the
caller can catch this exception and handle it correctly. Then, you don't need
a hasLogZ function/constant that tells whether this functionality is available.
- Add an option to tests/test that it doesn't report the time needed; this is
useful for the regression testing.

DONE IN PREVIOUS COMMITS:
- Added a few methods to BipartiteGraph
- Improved ClusterGraph implementation (taken from SVN head)
- Improved MaxSpanningTree algorithm (using boost::graph library, taken from SVN head)
- Updated doxygen.conf
- Made compatible with Visual C++
- Merged improved index.h from svn
