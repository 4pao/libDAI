- BipartiteGraph::isConnected should be optimized using boost::graph
- http://www.boost.org/development/requirements.html#Design_and_Programming
- Would it be a good idea to cache second-order neighborhoods (delta's) in BipGraph?
- Would it be a good idea to add the variable label -> index hashmap in FactorGraph,
  to replace the linear searches that are performed every time for findVar()?
  No, a better idea is to avoid calls to findVar() as much as possible.
- Would it be a good idea to remove the states() caching from VarSet? 
  Then, we could turn a VarSet into an IndexSet (set of integers).
- Can the FactorGraph constructors be optimized further?
- Idea: use a PropertySet as output of a DAIAlg, instead of functions like maxDiff and Iterations().
- A DAIAlg<T> should not inherit from a FactorGraph/RegionGraph, but should store a reference to it
- Add max-product to BP
- Remove x2x?
- Remove MR?

TODO FOR RELEASE:
- Test {Visual C++, cygwin, gcc various version} compatibility; state tested compilers/build environments in README
- Figure out which libraries are required and document in README
  boost headers, boost::program_options library, boost::graph library,
  boost::math library (under Windows)
- Change email address
