About libDAI
------------
libDAI is a free/open source C++ library (licensed under GPL) that provides
implementations of various (approximate) inference methods for discrete
graphical models. libDAI supports arbitrary factor graphs with discrete
variables; this includes discrete Markov Random Fields and Bayesian Networks.

The library is targeted at researchers; to be able to use the library, a good
understanding of graphical models is needed.


Limitations
-----------
libDAI is not intended to be a complete package for approximate inference.
Instead, it should be considered as an "inference engine", providing various
inference methods. In particular, it contains no GUI, currently only supports
its own file format for input and output (although support for standard file
formats may be added later), and provides very limited visualization
functionalities.


Features
--------
Currently, libDAI supports the following (approximate) inference methods:

    * Exact inference by brute force enumeration;
    * Exact inference by junction-tree methods;
    * Mean Field;
    * Loopy Belief Propagation [KFL01];
    * Tree Expectation Propagation [MiQ04];
    * Generalized Belief Propagation [YFW05];
    * Double-loop GBP [HAK03];
    * Various variants of Loop Corrected Belief Propagation [MoK07, MoR05];
    * Gibbs sampler;
    * Conditioned BP [EaG09].

In addition, libDAI supports parameter learning of conditional probability
tables by Expectation Maximization.


Why C++?
--------
Because libDAI is implemented in C++, it is very fast compared with
implementations in MatLab (a factor 1000 faster is not uncommon). libDAI does
provide a (limited) MatLab interface for easy integration with MatLab.

Acknowledgments
---------------
This work is part of the Interactive Collaborative Information Systems (ICIS) 
project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, grant BSIK03024. 
I would like to thank Martijn Leisink for providing the basis on which libDAI has been built.


Documentation
-------------
Some doxygen documentation is available. Install doxygen and use "make doc" to build the
documentation. If the documentation is not clear enough, feel free to send me an email 
(or even better, to improve the documentation!).

A description of the factor graph (.fg) file format can be found in the file FILEFORMAT.


Compatibility
-------------
The code has been developed under Debian GNU/Linux with the GCC compiler suite.
libDAI compiles successfully with g++ versions 3.4, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3.

libDAI has also been successfully compiled with MS Visual Studio 2008 under Windows
(but not all build targets are supported yet) and with Cygwin under Windows.

Finally, libDAI has been compiled successfully on MacOS X.


Quick start (linux/cygwin/Mac OS X)
-----------------------------------
You need:
- a recent version of gcc (at least version 3.4)
- GNU make
- doxygen
- graphviz
- recent boost C++ libraries (at least version 1.34, or 1.37 for cygwin)

On Debian/Ubuntu, you can easily install all these packages with a single command:
"apt-get install g++ make doxygen graphviz libboost-dev libboost-graph-dev libboost-program-options-dev"
(root permissions needed).

On Mac OS X (10.4 is known to work), these packages can be installed easily via MacPorts.
First, install MacPorts according to the instructions at http://www.macports.org/
Then, a simple "sudo port install gmake boost doxygen graphviz"
should be enough to install everything that is needed.

On Cygwin, the prebuilt Cygwin package boost-1.33.1-x is known not to work.
You can however obtain the latest boost version (you need at least 1.37.0)
from http://www.boost.org/ and compile/install it with:

  ./configure
  make
  make install


To build the libDAI source, first copy a template Makefile.* to Makefile.conf
(for example, copy Makefile.LINUX to Makefile.conf if you use GNU/Linux). 
Then, edit the Makefile.conf template to adapt it to your local setup.
Especially directories may differ from system to system. Finally, run
    
    make

If the build was successful, you can test the example program:

    ./example tests/alarm.fg

or the more elaborate test program:

    tests/testdai --aliases tests/aliases.conf --filename tests/alarm.fg --methods JTREE_HUGIN BP_SEQMAX


Quick start (Windows)
---------------------
You need:
- A recent version of MicroSoft Visual Studio (2008 works)
- recent boost C++ libraries (version 1.34 or higher)
- GNU make (can be obtained from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net)
For the regression test, you need:
- GNU diff, GNU sed (can be obtained from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net)

To build the source, copy Makefile.WINDOWS to Makefile.conf. Then, edit 
Makefile.conf to adapt it to your local setup. Finally, run (from the command line)
    
    make

If the build was successful, you can test the example program:

    example tests\alarm.fg

or the more elaborate test program:

    tests\testdai --aliases tests\aliases.conf --filename tests\alarm.fg --methods JTREE_HUGIN BP_SEQMAX


Quick start (MatLab)
--------------------
You need:
- MatLab
- The platform-dependent requirements described above

First, you need to build the libDAI source as described above for your
platform. By default, the MatLab interface is disabled, so before compiling the
source, you have to enable it in the Makefile.conf by setting
"WITH_MATLAB=true". Also, you have to configure the MatLab-specific parts of
Makefile.conf to match your system (in particular, the Makefile variables ME,
MATLABDIR and MEX). The MEX file extension depends on your platform; for a
64-bit linux x86_64 system this would be "ME=.mexa64", for a 32-bit linux x86
system this would be "ME=.mexglx". If you are unsure about your MEX file
extension: it needs to be the same as what the MatLab command "mexext" returns.
The required MEX files are built by issuing

    make

from the command line. The MatLab interface is much less powerful than using
libDAI from C++. There are two reasons for this: (i) it is boring to write MEX
files; (ii) the large performance penalty paid when large data structures (like
factor graphs) have to be converted between their native C++ data structure to
something that MatLab understands.

A simple example of how to use the MatLab interface is the following (entered
at the MatLab prompt), which performs exact inference by the junction tree
algorithm and approximate inference by belief propagation on the ALARM network:

    cd path_to_libdai/matlab
    [psi] = dai_readfg ('../examples/alarm.fg');
    [logZ,q,md,qv,qf] = dai (psi, 'JTREE', '[updates=HUGIN,verbose=0]')
    [logZ,q,md,qv,qf] = dai (psi, 'BP', '[updates=SEQMAX,tol=1e-9,maxiter=10000,logdomain=0]')

where "path_to_libdai" has to be replaced with the directory in which libDAI
was installed. For other algorithms and their parameters, see
tests/aliases.conf.
