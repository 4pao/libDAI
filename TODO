To do for the next release (0.2.3):

Improve documentation:

	emalg.h
	doc.h

Improve documentation of all .props structs.

Improve documentation of inference algorithm constructors (indicate constraints on factor graph)

Write a concept/notations page for the documentation,
explaining the concepts of "state" (index into a 
multi-dimensional array, e.g., one corresponding
to the Cartesian product of statespaces of variables)
and "linear index". This should make it easier to
document index.h and varset.h
