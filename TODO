To do for the next release (0.2.3):

- Rename VarSet::calcState(), VarSet::calcStates() and make them non-member functions.
- Update ChangeLog

Finally:

- Set DAI_VERSION and DAI_DATE correctly (all occurences)
- Build documentation and make a copy
- Find out how to tag the git commit
- Make a tarball which does not include the .git stuff
