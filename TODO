To do for the next release (0.2.3):

Improve documentation of all .props structs.

Write a concept/notations page for the documentation,
explaining the concepts of "state" (index into a 
multi-dimensional array, e.g., one corresponding
to the Cartesian product of statespaces of variables)
and "linear index". This should make it easier to
document index.h and varset.h

Rename VarSet::calcState(), VarSet::calcStates() and make them non-member functions;
make the State class a more prominent part of libDAI (and document it clearly, explaining
the concept of state); add more optimized variants of the State class like IndexFor (e.g. for TFactor<>::slice()).

- Merge NIPS MLOSS workshop sheet info

- Merge website info


Finally:

- Set DAI_VERSION and DAI_DATE correctly (all occurences)
- Build documentation and make a copy
- Find out how to tag the git commit
- Make a tarball which does not include the .git stuff
