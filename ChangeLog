libDAI-0.2.2 (2008-??-??)
-------------------------
 
- Renamed DEBUG to DAI_DEBUG to avoid conflicts
* Contributions by ???:
  - Renamed variable _N in mr.* for compatibility with g++ under cygwin
* Contributions by Giuseppe Passino:
  - removed "using namespace std;" from header files - bad practice
  - moved header files in include/dai and sources in src
  - changed #ifndefs to GNU style
  - added extra warning checks (-W -Wextra) and fixed resulting warnings
* Contributions by Christian Wojek, resulting in vast speed and memory improvements
  for large factor graphs:
  - Sparse implementation of nodes->edge conversion table _E12ind in bipgraph.h
  - New FactorGraph constructor that constructs from given ranges of factors
    and variables
  - Optimization of FactorGraph constructors
* FactorGraph constructors no longer check for short loops and for
  negative entries. Also, the normtype is now Prob::NORMPROB by default.
* Moved everything into namespace "dai"
